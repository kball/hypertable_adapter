hypertable_adapter
==================

Hypertable Adapter allows ActiveRecord to communicate with Hypertable.

In ActiveRecord, each supported data store has an adapter that implements
functionality specific to that store as well as providing metadata for
data held within the store.  Features implemented by adapters typically
include:

  * connection handling
  * list of tables
  * list of columns per data
  * low-level support for qualified columns
  * statement execution (selects, writes, etc.)
  * latency measurement
  * fixture handling

The adapter provides low-level integration between Hypertable and
ActiveRecord.  A separate library called HyperRecord is required to fully 
integrate the two.

Basic Hypertable Adapter Configuration
======================================

TODO: Replace the following documentation when the Adapter is rewritten
to use Thrift (instead of RICE).

Before creating a HyperRecord class, you must declare a hypertable 
connection in config/database.yml

 hypertable:
   adapter: hypertable
   executable: /opt/hypertable/current/bin/hypertable
   configuration_file: config/environments/hypertable.cfg

Or, if you need to do it in code outside of database.yml:

 ActiveRecord::Base.configurations['hypertable'] = {
   'adapter' => 'hypertable',
   'executable' => '/opt/hypertable/current/bin/hypertable',
   'configuration_file' => 'config/environments/hypertable.cfg'
 }

The key named 'executable' refers to the absolute path of the Hypertable 
client executable. The key named 'configuration_file' refers to the 
relative path of the Hypertable client configuration file. This file tells 
the client where to find the Hypertable cluster, specifies default 
timeouts, etc.
